# dotfiles

this repo contains some of my dotfiles I use on my linux builds (usually arch or arch based like endevouros)

## folders

this repo contains dotfiles of multiple systems or installations of systems i had.
here is a list of them and their key points.

`arch-bspwm` my first arch bspwm setup usees things like

- bspwm - WM
- sxhkd - keyboard shortcut manager
- x - window server
- picom - compoistor
- polybar - bar
- dunst - notification handler
- kitty - terminal
- oh-my-posh - prompt
- rofi - launcher

`arch-bspwm-theme` used a theme from someone else and adjusted it to my linking, after this setup I switch to a hackintosch

- bspwm - WM
- sxhkd - keyboard shortcut manager
- ...

`endevour-hyrpland` after my hackintosch stint I switch to endevoruos with wayland and bc of wayland I switch from bspwm to hyprland.

- hyrland - compositor / DE / WM
- wayland
- foot - wayland based terminal
- rofi - launcher tool
- waybar - wayland based bar

`endevour-gnome` when I started using my hyrpand setup in school I noticed I didn't like the un-completed themaning and un-professinal and smi working rofi UIs so i switched to Gnome which helped me a lot with being a bit more productive and prepared for school lessions without any hussle.

- gnome - compoitor / DE / WM
- wayland
- alacritty - terminal
- helix - terminal based editor simlilar to vim written in rust
